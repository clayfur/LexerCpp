Simple lexical analyser I made for my Compiler Design Labwork to experiment with using reguilar expressions in C++.

## What it is?

A lexer, also known as a lexical analyzer, is a program that processes an input string of characters and converts it into a sequence of tokens. Tokens are meaningful sequences of characters, such as keywords, identifiers, operators, and symbols, which are used by a parser to understand the structure of the input. The lexer typically removes whitespace and comments and categorizes the input into these tokens based on predefined rules or patterns, often specified using regular expressions.

## What it does?

Simply identifies lexemes in the input C language code and outputs a list of tokens.

## Example

Using the C source code file in this repository will provide this output.
